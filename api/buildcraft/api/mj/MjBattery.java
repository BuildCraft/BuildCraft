/**
 * This annotation is used for tiles that need to interface with BuildCraft
 * energy framework, a.k.a MinecraftJoule or MJ. In order to receive power,
 * tiles, need to declare a double field, with the annotation
 * MjBattery. BuildCraft machines able to provide power will then connect to
 * these tiles, and feed energy up to max capacity. It's the responsibility
 * of the implementer to manually decrease the value of the energy, as he
 * simulates energy consumption. On each cycle, per power input, machines can
 * receive up to "maxReceivedPerCycle" units of energy. As an optional behavior,
 * the system can have a minimum amount of energy consumed even if the system
 * is at max capacity, modelized by the "minimumConsumption" value.
 *
 * If the field designated by MjBattery is an object, then BuildCraft will
 * consider that this is a case of a nested battery, and will look for the
 * field in the designated object.
