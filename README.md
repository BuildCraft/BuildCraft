### Compiling and packaging Buildcraft
1. Ensure that `Apache Ant` (found [here](http://ant.apache.org/)) is installed correctly on your system.
 * Linux users will need the latest version of astyle installed as well.
1. Create a base directory for the build
1. Clone the Buildcraft repository into `basedir/BuildCraft/`
 * Optional: Copy BuildCraft localization repository into `basedir/BuildCraft-Localization`
1. Copy the minecraft bin dir and minecraft_server.jar into `basedir/jars/`
1. Navigate to basedir/Buildcraft in a shell and run `ant clean package` (this will take 2-5 minutes)
1. The compiled and obfuscated jar will be in basedir/build/dist

Your directory structure should look like this:
***

    basedir
    \- jars
     |- minecraft_server.jar
     \- bin
      |- minecraft.jar
      |- ...
    \- BuildCraft
     |- buildcraft_resources
     |- common
     |- ...
    \- BuildCraft-Localization
     |- lang
