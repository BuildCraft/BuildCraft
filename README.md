## BuildCraft 3.4 for 1.4.7

### Contributing
If you wish to submit a pull request to fix bugs or broken behavior feel free to
do so. If you would like to add features or change existing behaivour or balance,
please discuss it before submiting the pull request.

### Compiling and packaging Buildcraft
1. **Ensure you're using Java version 11!**
2. Run `./gradlew build` (Windows is not currently supported)
3. Final jar will be in build/libs

### Localizations
1.4.7 localizations are frozen in time as the localizations repo was restructured
for the assets changeover, and an old branch was not maintained. If there is
interest in further updates to localizations for BuildCraft 3.4, then I can
start a fork of the localizations repo.
