## Welcome to Buildcraft on GitHub

### Reporting an issue

Please open an issue for a bug report only if:

* you are sure the bug is caused by BuildCraft and not by any other mod,
* you have at least one of the following:
  * a crash report, 
  * means of reproducing the bug in question,
  * screenshots/videos/etc. to demonstrate the bug.

**If you are not sure if a bug report is valid, please use the "Ask Help!" subforum.**

Please only use **official BuildCraft releases** for any kind of bug reports unless otherwise told to do by the BuildCraft team. Custom builds (for instance from Jenkins) are unsupported, often buggy and will **not** get any support from the developers.

Please check if the bug has been reported beforehand. Also, provide the version of BuildCraft used - if it's a version compiled from source, link to the commit/tree you complied from.

Please mention if you are using MCPC+, Cauldron, OptiFine, FastCraft or any other mods which optimize or otherwise severely modify the functioning of the Minecraft engine. That is very helpful when trying to reproduce a bug.

Please do not open issues for features unless you are a member of the BuildCraft team. For that, use the "Feature Requests" subforum.

BuildCraft, being an open-source project, gives you the right to submit a pull request if a particular fix or feature is important to you. However, if the change in question is major, please contact the team beforehand - we wish to prevent wasted effort.

### Contributing

If you wish to submit a pull request to fix bugs or broken behaviour feel free to do so. If you would like to add 
features or change existing behaviour or balance, please discuss it on the feature ideas board before submitting a PR (http://mod-buildcraft.com/forums/index.php?board=7.0).

Do not submit pull requests which solely "fix" formatting. As these kinds of changes are usually very intrusive in commit history and everyone has their own idea what "proper formatting" is, they should be done by one of the main contributors. 
Please only submit "code cleanup", if the changes actually have a substantial impact on readability.

PR implementing new features or changing large portions of code are helpful. But if you're doing such a change and if it gets accepted, please don't "fire and forget". Complex changes are introducing bugs, and as thourough as testing and peer review may be, there will be bugs. Please carry on playing your changes after initial commit and fix residual issues. It is extremely frustrating for others to spend days fixing regressions introduced by unmaintained submissions.

#### Frequently reported

* java.lang.AbstractMethodError, java.lang.NoSuchMethodException
  * A mod has not updated to the current BuildCraft API
  * You are not using the correct version of BuildCraft for your Forge/Minecraft versions
  * You are using the dev version on a normal game instance (or vice versa)
* Render issue (Quarry causes flickering) - Try without OptiFine first! This is a known issue with some versions of OptiFine.

### Compiling and packaging Buildcraft
1. Ensure that `Java` (found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)), `Git` (found [here](http://git-scm.com/)) are installed correctly on your system.
 * Optional: Install `Gradle` (found [here](http://www.gradle.org/downloads))
1. Create a base directory for the build
1. Clone the Buildcraft repository into 'baseDir/BuildCraft/' recursivly
1. Navigate to basedir/BuildCraft in a shell and run one of two commands:
 * `gradlew setupCIWorkspace build` to just build a current jar (this may take a while).
 * `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` to setup a complete developement enviroment.
 * With `Gradle` installed: use `gradle` instead of `gradlew`
 * On Windows: use `gradlew.bat` instead of `gradlew`
1. The compiled and obfuscated jar will be in 'baseDir/BuildCraft/build/libs'
2. The compiles and obfuscated module jars will be in 'baseDir/BuildCraft/modules'

Your directory structure should look like this before running gradle:
***

    baseDir
    \- BuildCraft
     |- buildcraft_resources
     |- common
     |- ...
     \- BuildCraftAPI
      |- api
      |- ...
     \- BuildCraft-Localization
      |- lang
      |- ...

***

And like this after running gradle:
***

    basedir
    \- BuildCraft
     |- .gradle
     |- build
     |- buildcraft_resources
     |- common
     |- ...
     \- BuildCraftAPI
      |- api
      |- ...
     \- BuildCraft-Localization
      |- lang
      |- ...

***

### Localizations

Localizations can be submitted [here](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft-Localization). Localization PRs against
this repository will have to be rejected.

### Depending on BuildCraft

Add the following to your build.gradle file:
```
repositories {
    ivy {
        name "BuildCraft"
        artifactPattern "http://www.mod-buildcraft.com/releases/BuildCraft/[revision]/[module]-[revision]-[classifier].[ext]"
    }
}

dependencies {
    deobfCompile name: "buildcraft", version: "7.2.5"
}
```
Where `7.2.5` is the desired version of BuildCraft.
