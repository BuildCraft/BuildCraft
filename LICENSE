Minecraft Mod Public License
============================

Version 1.0.2

0. Definitions
--------------

MMPL: This license.

Minecraft: Denotes a copy of the Minecraft game licensed by Mojang AB.

User: Anybody that interacts with the software in one of the following ways:
   - play
   - decompile or disassemble
   - recompile, compile, reassemble, or assemble
   - modify
   - distribute
The user must own Minecraft.

Mod: The software; mod code designated by the present license, in source form, binary
form, as obtained standalone, as part of a wider distribution or resulting from
the compilation of the original or modified sources.

Sources: The source code files of the software, including resource files,
heirarchy, etc. If the software is written in an assembly language file format
which supports comments, the corresponding assembly files (which support
comments) are considered sources. Assembly language "source" files which do
not support comments are considered binary files, even though they are not
"executable".

Owner: Copyright owner(s) of the mod, or authorized representatives on their
behalf. Owners double as users, by necessity.

Dependency: Code required for the mod to work properly. This includes 
dependencies required to compile the code as well as any file or modification
that is explicitely or implicitely required for the mod to be working.

1. Scope
--------

The present license is granted to any user of the mod. As a prerequisite, 
the user must be using a liscensed copy of Minecraft.

2. Liability
------------

This mod is provided 'as is' with no warranties, implied or otherwise. The owner
of this mod takes no responsibility for any damages incurred from the use of
this mod. This mod may alter fundamental parts of the Minecraft game, parts of
Minecraft may not work with this mod installed. All damages caused from the use
or misuse of this mod fall on the user.

3. Play rights
--------------

The user is allowed to install this mod on a client and/or a server and to play 
without restriction. The user is free to play any modified version of this mod,
and will not be held responsible for playing a modified version which was
illegally distributed (although if the same user distributed the modified
version to begin with, they are still responsible).

4. Modification rights
----------------------

The user specifically may not modify the license, regardless of rights
afforded below.

The user has the right to decompile/disassemble the binary code. The user may
look at and modify the resulting decompiled code/disassembly. The user may
also look at and modify the original source code. The user may compile,
recompile, assemble, and reassemble the original or said modified code. The
user may also modify the raw binary code, if they so wish.

Unless specified in section 6, the user may NOT distribute or redistribute
modified code or binaries.

5. Derivation rights
--------------------

The user has the rights to derive code from this mod, that is to say to
write code that extends or instanciate the mod classes or interfaces, refer to
its objects, or calls its functions. This code is known as "derived" code, and 
can be licensed under a license different from this mod.

Derived code sometimes depends on a modified version of the original mod. In
this case, the modifications are still subject to distribution under the terms
of section 6; however, the derived code may either packaged with the modified
code under the terms of section 6 or packaged seperately under its own
license.

6. Distribution
---------------

The user is allowed to redistribute this mod partially or in totality, either
by itself or as a part of a larger distribution package, if specific
conditions are satisfied.

One important exception is a binary file which has been modified by editing
the raw binary code, for example raw classfiles modified with a hex editor
may not be redistributed directly (even in a jar!). The user may, however,
distribute patch files, so that the end-user (who is recieving the patches)
may modify the raw binary code themselves as allowed under section 4.

Forms of the mod which may be distributed under the relevant subsequent terms
of this section include but are not limited to:
   - original binary, source, or disassembled forms of the mod
   - modified versions of these binary, source, or disassembled files, as well
     as binaries resulting from recompilation or reassembly
   - any patch to the mod's binary, source, or disassembed files
   - any portion of its binary, source, or disassembled files, or of modified
     versions thereof

When distributing binary files, the user must provide means to obtain its 
entire set of sources or modified sources at no costs. It is for this reason
that binary files which have been modified in the raw may not be distributed.

All distributions of this mod, in whole or in part, must remain licensed under either this version
or the most recent version of the MMPL.

All dependencies that this mod has on other mods or classes must be licensed
under conditions comparable to this version of MMPL, with the exception of the
Minecraft code and the mod loading framework (e.g. Forge Mod Loader, ModLoader, ModLoaderMP or
Bukkit).
