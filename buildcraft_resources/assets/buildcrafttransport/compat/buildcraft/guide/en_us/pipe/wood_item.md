Transferring items from one place to another requires a way of extracting items from chests, and this manifests itself in the form of a Wooden Pipe!

This pipe can only extract from a single side at a time, so to change sides you must right click on one of the sides with a $[special.stack](buildcraftcore:wrench).
$[special.all_crafting]{buildcrafttransport:pipe_wood_item,1,-1}
