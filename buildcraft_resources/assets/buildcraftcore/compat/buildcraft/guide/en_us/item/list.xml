Just insert the item you want the other items to revolve around in the furthest left slot and select the right button you want.

Having to collect insert every single item of a certain item you want to filter can be tedious, that's why the List has different modes:
Exact Match: The item inserted is the same item. E.g.Has the same amount of damage and enchantments.
Type: Items which the same but made of a different materials. E.g. All types of gears made of different materials.
Material: Items which are made of exactly the same material. E.g. All items made of Copper and all the different types of copper.

The items provided by the buttons may not provide all types/material of items.
