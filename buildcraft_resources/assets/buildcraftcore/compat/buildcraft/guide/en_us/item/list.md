Just insert the item you want the other items to revolve around in the furthest left slot and select the right button you want.

Having to collect insert every single item of a certain item you want to filter can be tedious, that's why the List has different modes:
Exact Match: The item inserted is the same item. E.g.Has the same amount of damage and enchantments.
Type: Items which the same but made of a different materials. E.g. for an iron gear, this would match against any sort of gear, for example a wooden gear, stone gear, etc.
Material: Items which are made of exactly the same material. E.g. for an iron gear, this would match against anything made directly out of iron: such as iron blocks, ingots, ore, or nuggets.

Unfortunatly not all items in the game are supported, for example this doesn't .
