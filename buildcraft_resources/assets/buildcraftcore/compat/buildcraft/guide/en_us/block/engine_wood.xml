Due to the little amount of MJ they produce, they are only really suitable to operate simple devices such as powering pipes or certain simple machines.

<chapter name="Engine Mechanics"/>
BuildCraft engines have 5 temperature stages, which determines the speed the engine runs at: Blue, Green, Yellow, Red and Black.
Unlike more powerful engines when activated, Redstone Engines <bold>cannot overheat</bold> and turn black when the power has nowhere to go and it will keep running.
Engines will always connect to the nearest compatible MJ consumer but Redstone engines will not connect to kinesis pipes and will only connect to certain machines.
You can use a Wrench to rotate it to change which block it is powering.

As with all engines, it <bold>requires a redstone signal to run.</bold>
Gates can be used to detect the engines temperature stages to help you control them.
