The chute, formerly the Hopper, is a fast single block inventory which is able to directly insert items into pipes as well as multiple inventories at once in all directions (including upwards).

Similar to the hopper, the chute is able to pick up items from off the ground if items are on top or below and it is facing them slowly. This can be sped up by being powered by a Redstone Engine.
