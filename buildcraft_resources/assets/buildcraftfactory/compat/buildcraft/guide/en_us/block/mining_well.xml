<chapter name="Information"/>
It will mine directly downwards below where it is placed and will automatically output the blocks it breaks into any inventories or pipes placed next to it. Failing to find any pipes or inventories, it will then through the items out into the world.
The harder the block it is trying to break is, the longer it takes to mine.

As with most machines, it requires power. The more power you supply it, the faster it will dig.
If you give it a redstone signal, the Mining Well will stop running.
