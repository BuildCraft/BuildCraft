To gather fluids from the world, place a pump above a source block of the fluid you want to pump up and supply it with power.

The fluids sources found below will be 'sucked' up from the top source downwards and will be auto-outputted into adjacent pipes/tanks.
It will pump fluids in a 64 blocks radius from top to bottom and the outer edges of the connecting fluids inwards.

As with most machines, it requires power. The more power you supply it, the faster it will pump.
Applying a redstone signal to the pump will stop the pump from pumping so be careful where you place your levers.
