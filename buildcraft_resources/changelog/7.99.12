Changes:

* Updated to minecraft 1.12.2
* The heat exchange is now a single item, rather than 3. It's still placed in the same way as before though.
  * Existing heat exchangers probably won't load up properly. 
  * In addition, its default texture is now closer to iron and quartz pipes than tanks

Bugs fixed:

* Fixed the pipe event bus calling event handlers multiple times (not fully fixed yet though)
* Added the version update JSON link.
