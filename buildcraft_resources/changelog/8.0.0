Breaking Changes:

* Factory
  * Chute:
    * Does not extract from inventories
    * Inserts into entities, blocks (including pipes)
    * Is omnidirectional (the opening can face any of 6 sides, the pipe/chest exit can face any of the 5 remaining sides)
    * When powered with a engine, it can pick up entities from the ground near it
      * If facing up then it can pick up without a seperate power source (but slowly)

* Transport:
  * Actions and triggers on gates are based upon the side that they act on, rather than being generic and deciding which tile to use by themselves
  * Gate expansions have been moved to separate pluggables
    * The "Autarchic gate" expansion is now the "Pipe Pulsar" pluggable, and requires a redstone engine to craft
  * Stripes pipe mining speed is now determined by how much power you give it, it is no longer instant

* Silicon:
  * Removed the emerald chipset and the pulsating chipset
    * All recipes using those chipsets now use a different item
  * Pipe wire is now placed on the 8 corners of a pipe, rather than anywhere on the pipe.
    * Allows for up to 8 different colours of wire on a single pipe.
    * Wires must be placed next to each other to transfer a signal.

* Robotics:
  * Zone Planner:
    * 3D map
    * Brushes slots are now not fake slots but slots for storing brushes in it (empty in new machine)
    * By default all layers are displayed
    * When taking colored brush from slot with mouse layer of its color will be displayed
    * Left-click while having colored brush on your cursor to add rectangle to layer
    * Right-click while having colored brush on your cursor to subtract rectangle to layer
    * Now stores layers data relatively to its position (useful for copying it with architect table and builder)

Additions:

* Lib:
  * Moved "buildcraft.core.lib" into its own module, which is contained within the "core" jar file, or can be downloaded seperatly
    * This allows developers to use all of the BC library code, without forcing players to also have BuildCraft itself
  * Added the guide book, a form of ingame documentation

* Core:
  * Added volume boxes
    * Right-click block with volume box to place in near this block
    * Right-click volume box with wrench to activate editing mode
      * Move and look to change size
      * Right-click to confirm
      * Shift+Right-click to cancel
    * Addons:
      * Right-click corner of volume box with addon to install it
      * Right-click addon with wrench to open its GUI
      * Shift+Right-click addon with wrench to remove it
    * Shift+Right-click volume box with wrench to remove it
    * Most blocks support it as new alternative to old land mark system

* Builders:
  * Filling planner (volume box addon):
    * Visibly shows a filler pattern in the world, without having to set up a filler.
    * Placing a filler down to use that volume box will make the filler use its pattern.

Improvements:

* General:
  * All coloured items (pipes, paintbrushes, pipe wire) are displayed with an appropriate text colour infront
    * This behaviour can be toggled in the config (GUI or file)
  * Tanks in GUI's now display their contents
  * Tanks in GUI's can be added to or removed from by clicking on them with a bucket or other fluid container in hand
    * This removes most of the slots found in various fluid holding blocks, such as the combustion engine
  * Displayed fluid values can be displayed in buckets or millibuckets, and in long or short form
    * This behaviour can be toggled in the config, or in game
  * You can now clone items from phantom slots if you are in creative mode
  * Gui ledgers now render their contents even if they are not fully open
  * Most GUI's now have a "help" ledger, which describes whatever GUI element you are hovering over
  * Tiles save the first valid player as their owner, which is used as the fake player UUID
    * This owner is displayed in a ledger in the GUI, alongside the face of the owner

* Factory:
  * Pump, Mining Well:
    * Both have tube made with fake unbreakable blocks

* Builders:
  * Quarry:
    * The drill bit has an animation while it is mining
    * The frame has a collision box (so you can walk on top of it)
    * The frame will break automatically when you break quarry
  * Architect Table
    * Now has scanning animation
  * Builder:
    * Now uses builtin Minecraft methods for rotating blocks (for default schematics)
    * JSON schematics system
  * Builder, Filler:
    * Now have counters ledger which shows how many blocks left to place and to break
  * Snapshots (templates + blueprints) items:
    * When hovered display preview (in GUIs)

* Transport:
  * The wooden-diamond pipe (formally known as the emerald pipe) shows the current index of what is being extracted, when in round-robin mode.
  * The stripes pipe now shows which direction it is pointing.
  * Gates:
    * Added a small selection area for changing between different triggers, actions and parameters. Complex params still require the existing mechanism (for example with itemstack params)
    * Dragging a trigger or action with the secondary mouse button will copy that statement, and can be placed in a similar way to dragging from the side selections
  * Facades:
    * Now have shape of square frustum
    * Added support for grass, leaves and sponge facades
    * Now glass, fences and other blocks connect to them
    * Pipes now inherit facades' blocks resistance (depending on side where explosion took place)
  * Schematic Single:
    * Item that stores data of 1 block (like 1x1x1 blueprint)
    * Right-click empty one to record data
    * Right-click used to place recorded block (if they are need items in your inventory then they will be taken, else nothing will happen)
    * Shift+Right-click used to clear it

* Silicon:
  * Added the remaining 12 colours of pipe wire.
