Additions:

* Ported the power adaptor
* Added (code) functionality for addons to stop custom tanks from connecting to other tanks.

Changes:

* Phased facades can now only be fully hollow or not. This breaks the current facade API.

Improvements:

* The debugger item can now be used in survival to view the F3 debug info on buildcraft blocks (previously this required creative mode)
* The guide book now has a search bar.
* Guide book entries can be any object, rather than just item stacks.
  * You can now specify "source" and "type" for changing the type.
  * Currently triggers and actions are the only additions. The type is "buildcraft:statement", and the source is a registry name of a statement (trigger or action)
  * Unfortunately the only way of finding out a statement's ID is via the source code. Woops.
* Added the "has work" capability (and implicitly the has work trigger) to the distiller.
* The autoworkbench now shows its filters per slot, and distributes the filters evenly so that the most number of crafting operations can occur
  * For example, when crafting a dispenser (which needs 8 cobblestone, 1 bow and 1 redstone) this will filter 1 slot for cobblestone, 1 for redstone, and 8 for bows as bows cannot stack.
* Filtered inventories no longer loose the item when loading from disk if the item does not match the filter. 

Bug fixes:

* Fix torches being placable on pipes (without any pluggables that they could rest on).
* Fix fluid tanks sometimes leaving a visible gap between the above and below tanks.
* Fix the quarry not loading enough chunks.
* Fix the filler and builder not using power smoothly.
* Fix gates not saving the currently emmited wires, leading to buggy state cells.
* Fix the list item not populating examples from all items at once.
* Fix the quarry not checking to see if it is facing directly away from a marker box.
* Fix the guide book swapping "matchNbt" and "matchMeta".
* Fix the builder and filler using up power unevenly.
* [#3954] Chisel facades don't render correctly.
* [#3977] The filtered buffer doesn't work properly with inventory level triggers.
* [#3981] Placing a pipe wire will also interact with a gate.
* [#3989] The Auto Workbench accepts items not used in its recipe.
* [#3994, #3995] Facades are sometimes solid even when they shouldn't be.
* [#4022] Gates don't save their current wire, leading to buggy state cells.
