Additions:

* [#3964] Add a config option to change the max fluid pumping distance (Yuki-nyan).
  * Currently this is limited between 16 and 128. The default is the old limit - 64.

Changes:

* The christmas event is over
  * Chocolate based names have been replaced with oil based ones.
  * A config option has been added (events.christmas_chocolate) to enable or disable the event.

API (code) Changes:

* IPipeRegistry.createItemForPipe now registers the returned items with forge, so that addons don't have to.
* Added IPipeRegistry.createUnnamedItemForPipe is similar to IPipeRegistry.createItemForPipe
  * With one exception: the caller must set the registry, unlocalised, and creative tabs.
  * This is accomplished by providing a Consumer<Item> in order to set the properties.
* [#3945] Added PipeEventTileState fired by certain functions inside TileEntity
  * Contained subclasses:
    * Invalidate: fired during TileEntity.invalidate()
    * Validate: fired during TileEntity.validate()
    * ChunkUnload: fired during TileEntity.onChunkUnload()
  * Added to allow the addon Additional Pipes to properly port the teleport pipe.

Bugs fixed:

* [#3891] The quarry sometimes goes into an infinite loop when calculating frame positions.
* [#3937] Disabling the facade item crashes the game.
* [#3944, #3965] The autoworkbench doesn't clear its old items properly, leading to buggy behaviour with containing items (such as buckets)
* [#3948] The autoworkbench doesn't craft fireworks properly when multiple things attempt to craft the same item.
* [#3886] The combustion engine doesn't move fluid containers around properly, either duplicating or voiding items and fluids.
* [#3869] Texture flickering and FPS drop on mining well when it's complete - likely turning on and off rapidly
* [#3953] Land and path markers are visible from all dimensions.
* [#3987] The obsidian pipe can connect to itself.
* [#3970] Disabling chunkloading, quitting, and then re-enabling and loading a world crashes.
