API (code) Changes:

* IPipeRegistry.createItemForPipe now registers the returned items with forge, so that addons don't have to.

Bugs fixed:

* [#3891] The quarry sometimes goes into an infinite loop when calculating frame positions.
* [#3937] Disabling the facade item crashes the game.
* [#3944] The autoworkbench doesn't clear its old items properly, leading to buggy behaviour with containing items (such as buckets)
* [#3948] The autoworkbench doesn't craft fireworks properly when multiple things attempt to craft the same item.
