Additions:

* [#3857] Re-added the config option to disallow infinite water pumping. Useful if a finite water mod is installed.
* Added a new config option: "display.useSwappableSprites". This disables sprite swapping functionality, which is used by other config options (such as colourblind mode)
  * Fixes [#3894] Optifine texture incompatibility
* Propely added config options for "itemRenderRotation", and "chunkLoaderLevel". The latter is technically just a boolean choice - only the quarry can chunkload at the moment.

Changes:

* Guide book contents JSON files no longer need a title element if they have an item_stack element, as the title will now be the item stack's display name.

Bugs fixed:

* [#3833] Missing lang entry for "Gelled Water" (item.gel.name) and "Water Gelifier" (item.waterGel.name)
* [#3853] Pipe item models have the incorrect lighting.
  * This might be altered in the future, as they are very dark now. Voice feedback on this please!
* [#3854] The architect table crashes if placed next to landmarks.
* [#3867] The chute inserts into living entities (so players or zombies, for example)
* [#3861] The filler has the missing block model in-world.
* Some modules accidently had hard dependencies on others when they shouldn't
  * [#3858] Core depends on Builders
  * [#3873] Lib depends on Silicon
    * Silicon depends on factory
* [#3874] Crash when breaking the heat exchanger
* [#3882] All fluid blocks except for one showed the missing texture.
* [#3884] Powering an obsidian transport pipe without any pipe connections crashes.
* The heat exchanger doesn't output properly.
* [#3925] Gates do not activate/deactivate redstone signals properly for farther blocks.
