Additions:

* [#3857] Re-added the config option to disallow infinite water pumping. Useful if a finite water mod is installed.

Changes:

* Guide book contents JSON files no longer need a title element if they have an item_stack element, as the title will now be the item stack's display name.

Bugs fixed:

* [#3833] Missing lang entry for "Gelled Water" (item.gel.name) and "Water Gelifier" (item.waterGel.name)
* [#3853] Pipe item models have the incorrect lighting.

* [#3854] The architect table crashes if placed next to landmarks.
* [#3867] The chute inserts into living entities (so players or zombies, for example)
* Some modules accidently had hard dependencies on others when they shouldn't
  * [#3858] Core depends on Builders
